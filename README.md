# Lazy Styles Generator

:tada: Lazy Styles Generator is a Sketch :gem: plugin that allows you to create and update shared styles across your sketch files or libraries with ease.
Based on the idea created by Luca Orio - [Sketch Styles Generator](https://github.com/lucaorio/sketch-styles-generator)

_This plugin was created using `skpm`. For a detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [skpm Readme](https://github.com/skpm/skpm/blob/master/README.md)._

## Questions

### Can I create thousands of styles in one go?
You can, if your system can handle it, however, it is probably better to batch them into 100s.

### How fast is it?
I have optimised the plugin as much as possible - If you can see any performance improvements in the code, please get in touch.
